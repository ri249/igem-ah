                            <h1>INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES</h1>
                            <p>Our project provides a solution to address the inequality in accessing therapeutic proteins. We have created a novel recombinant protein production system. This solution has the potential to further expedite and serve the rapidly increasing production of new biopharmaceuticals and has planted a seed for revolutionizing biopharmaceutical cost and pricing structures.</p>

                            <p>
                                A design thinking approach was used to guide our project design. For this, we conducted interviews with key stakeholders to identify the pain points in biopharmaceutical development, user experience, production, and sales today. Our findings have guided the scope of our project. And the final outcome, the service and business model along side of our product, was strongly influenced by the input from stakeholders. Thus ensuring that there is a real need for our solution.

                                <h3>What is design thinking?</h3>
                                <p>Design thinking is a process, that gives structure for creating innovations with user-driven focus. It helps in defining the experienced problems in existing solutions or habits by involving key stakeholders. The process thwart jumping into conclusions and assumptions while emphasizing dialogue and learning.(1)

                                    A key idea in design thinking is to discard the previously common habit of design being a downstream step of a developing process, including it in the development right from the beginning. (2)

                                    We wanted to include design thinking process into our project to make sure that our solution would have the best possible impact to our society by solving the most abundant issues.

                            <p>The sky rocket high prices of insulin in the United States has raised to the head lines during the past few years. Millions of people suffer due to not being able to pay for their medication. At the same time, insulin is only one of the numerous therapeutic proteins, all sold with relatively high prices compared to traditional synthesized pharmaceuticals. The production of therapeutic proteins, which are recombinant proteins, is a complex process. The amount of therapeutic protein pharmaceuticals is estimated to grow substantially in the future. Finding a suitable production platform can be challenging, and we wanted to investigate the possibilities a new platform could offer to find a deliberate solution.</p>

                            <h3>2.1 Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
                            <p>To identify the key stakeholders, all actors that could be affected or might have an effect on our project were mapped out. This was done based on the stakeholders’ interest towards recombinant proteins and their power on the production of these proteins (figure 1).</p>
                            <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/f/f6/T--Aalto-Helsinki--IHPfigure1.png" alt="Figure 1 here">

                            <p>
                                After conducting the stakeholder analysis, we chose to select the stakeholders with most interest towards our initial idea. These were pharmaceutical companies and other biomanufacturing companies, medical doctors and individuals who depend on therapeutic proteins as a treatment method. We acknowledged that large corporations, such as pharmaceutical companies, would have a very different viewpoint about therapeutic proteins than a patient who depends on the medicine. This is why the four stakeholders were bundled into two groups based on their relationship towards recombinant proteins: the patient perspective and the industrial perspective (figure 2).

                            <p>Interviews were conducted to empathize with the identified stakeholders and to understand them better. This gave us insights about how the recombinant protein production industry operates, as well as learn what living with therapeutic protein treatment is like. Interviewing the stakeholders was essential to confirm that the assumptions that we had about the biopharmaceutical production and therapeutic usage were either correct or incorrect.

                                The goal of the interviews was to determine challenges related to therapeutic protein treatment and production that the stakeholders are facing.

                At the same time, patients are unhappy with the administration methods of therapeutic protein products. Many patients in countries lacking a public health care system struggle economically to pay for their treatment.

        <h3>3.1 Patient perspective</h3>
        <p>To get a better idea of what we have learned, we mapped out the insights and what we had learned based on literature in a user journey. We created a user journey for the end users of therapeutic proteins.</p>
        <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/f/f9/T--Aalto-Helsinki--IHPfigure4.png/800px-T--Aalto-Helsinki--IHPfigure4.png" alt="Figure 4. User journey from patient perspective">
        <small>Figure 4. User journey from patient perspective</small>
        <br>
        <p>The main pain points for therapeutic protein use are related to getting the suitable treatment. This can be further categorized in three different types of cases.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The patient/the payer cannot afford medication and therefore can’t get the most suitable treatment. </li>
            <li>The patent is forced to quit the treatment due to severe side effects or high costs of the medication. </li>
            <li>There is no suitable product available to treat the disease. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Another issue in user experience that stands out is the usability of therapeutic protein products: therapeutic proteins are injected, often daily or many times a day, and might need to be stored in the fridge. Needles and injections were seen as the most unpleasant part of the treatment for patients who don’t have financial issues with their therapeutic protein treatment.

        <h3>3.2 Industrial perspective</h3>
        <h4>Drug Discovery & Development</h4>
        <img src="" alt="Figure 5. Challenges in the drug discovery and development process.">
        <small>Figure 5. Challenges in the drug discovery and development process.</small>
        <p class="mb-5"><b>Research and development</b> of biopharmaceuticals is slow and costly. The process requires massive capital investment, research and development of a successful drug costs on average up to 1 billion USD. It includes high risks for failure, only 1 out of 10 000 compounds developed end up in the market. Finally, it is time consuming, development of a new drug takes approximately 10-15 years. <b>The clinical trials</b> are highly regulated and require a lot of resources: manpower and time, and therefore of course also money. This is one key reason for the expensive selling prices of therapeutic proteins, in comparison to for instance industrial recombinant proteins. Due to their expensiveness, only a few companies have the resources to go through the clinical trials process. Smaller companies aim at selling their business before entering the clinical trials. <b>Market access</b> includes process for accepted  reimbursement from government or insurance companies. It is a critical point in order to successfully deliver a therapeutic to be used in patient care.</p>

        <h4>The Manufacturing Process</h4>
        <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/c/c6/T--Aalto-Helsinki--IHPfigure6.png" alt="Figure 6. Challenges in production of therapeutic proteins">
        <small>Figure 6. Challenges in production of therapeutic proteins</small>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Pricing of Therapeutic Protein Products</h4>
        <p>The pricing of a therapeutic proteins is complex and the selling price is affected by many factors. These include research and development costs, marketing costs, costs of goods, market prices of other pharmaceuticals and competition.</p>
        <p><b>Production</b> of therapeutic proteins is slow and requires advanced technologies compared to small molecule pharmaceuticals. Outsourcing manufacturing to low labour cost countries is not possible due to quality control reasons. All of these factors contribute to the high selling prices. Therefore, the production costs of biopharmaceuticals can be even greater than the research and development costs. </p>
        <p><b>Competition</b> can have a heavy effect on the pricing. If one manufacturer lowers the price, others are often forced to follow. The pricing for a product entering the market depends on the prices of other similar products on the market. On the other hand, competition is often minimal and in these situations, the price of the product can be set high. However, the market’s willingness to pay also plays a large role in the pricing.</p>
        <p>In Finland, and other countries with a government supported healthcare systems, patients easily think that the price of medication is not a big problem because of strong healthcare system support. However, it is important to note that if the medication was cheaper, the money could be allocated to other areas of the healthcare system.</p>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>After identifying the pain points, we started our ideation process for final product development. We focused on the following questions and sought for ideas to solve them.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row mb-5">
        <div class="col">
            <div class="qa_item">
                <p class="larger"><i>How might we reduce the costs of developing drugs and producing biopharmaceuticals?</i></p>
                <p>Research has shown, that increasing the titer and yield of protein produced can have a significant effect on the total production costs of recombinant proteins. According to previous calculations, simultaneously increasing the yield with 30% with a 10x greater titer, the number of bioreactors required could be decreased from 31 to 2 and thus the facility costs would decrease from 1067 M€ to 67 M€. At the same time the annual operating cost would decreased from 250 M€ to 43 M€ (Werner, 2014). Since
                    VibXPresso has 4x increased yield and
                    and production costs play a large role in the costing structure of therapeutic proteins, we assume that VibXPresso would have and reductive effect on the total costs of therapeutic proteins.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa_item">
                    <p class="larger"><i>How might we affect the selling prices of therapeutic proteins?</i></p>
                    <p>A production platform optimized for fast and high quality production of recombinant proteins has potential to reduce the costs of long term production of a therapeutic proteins. However, since selling biopharmaceuticals is a business, the decision of the retail prices are up to the pharmaceutical companies to decide. We came to the conclusion that lowering the costs of manufacturing wouldn’t alone guarantee any price reductions of the therapeutic proteins to the actual buyers of the drugs. To solve this problem, we wish to introduce VibXPresso in a form a non-profit organization. The NPO provides protein production platforms to pharma companies for a minimal fee. In return, the company</p>

                <div class="qa_item">
                    <p class="larger"><i>How might we shorten the time spent on developing new biopharmaceuticals?</i></p>
                    <p>As described above, development process of pharmaceuticals is extremely slow. Mostly due to the safety regulations, that contribute to making the clinical trials a time consuming process. Since the process is highly regulated we concluded that shortening the time spent on clinical trials was not something we could solve. However, a rapid production organisms would speed up the early research of a new pharmaceutical compound. Saving time in research would allow faster development and production of active pharmaceutical compounds (API).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa_item">
                    <p class="larger"><i>How might we avoid having to inject therapeutic protein products?</i></p>
                    <p>Therapeutic proteins have low oral bioavailability due to their tendency for pre-systematic degradation and poor gastrointestinal absorption (Philippart et al., 2015). The amount of active therapeutic protein ingredient absorbed orally is at least 100x less efficient compared to injectable medicines. At the moment, therapeutic protein production is not effective enough to allow the design of oral medication. Although oral medication would be more convenient for many patients, the cost of producing oral medicine is too high (as the medicines are already pricy in the quantities they are needed for the i.v or s.c. administration).</p>

                <p><i>“Adapting new manufacturing organisms would require adjustments in the existing production protocols and even establishment of a new facility. Therefore, it is not likely that a well established company would promptly change their already established processes.”</i></p>
                <p>An effective way to introduce our platform to the pharmaceutical industry would be to first present it for small drug developing companies. If the small company is successful and bought by a large pharma company –because a small R&D company seldom has the money for other than preclinical phases - the large company will then have to use the same methods when continuing the manufacturing, because all the research has been conducted with the method.</p>

                <h4>Feedback</h4>
                <p><i>“Two important issues to take into consideration when using V. natriegens in protein production are the salty conditions (1,5 % NaCl) that vibrio requires for growth and the excess heat, that will be produced as a consequence of the rapid division rate of the bacteria.“</i></p>
                <p>In addition to its rapid growth rate, Vibrio natriegens has additional unique features that need to be taken into consideration when utilizing the bacteria in industrial production. This is also one reason why we want to provide our product combined to a service, that includes consultation on how a production process needs to be engineered and developed to fit our chosen production organism V. natriegens. Our next step would be to create a feasible solution for managing the salt and heat conditions. To solve this, we would aim at engineering a mechanisms that allows to collect the excess heat and to reuse it as an additional energy source for the production plant.</p>

                <p>We wish to make the production processes more flexible. This could be achieved by using for example single use surge vessels instead of large stainless-steel tanks. This would lower the capital invested in the facility and could allow production of therapeutic proteins by a larger amount of different organization.

            <h3>Non-profit organisation</h3>
            <p>
                We have created a business plan for a non-profit organization with the help of the business model scaffold that was created in collaboration with the iGEM UNSW, iGEM KU-Leuven and UBS iGEM. The full business plan can be found from the Entrepreneurship section in our wiki.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our vision is to provide everyone the chance for affordable therapeutic protein
                treatment by hindering the unbearable increase of biopharmaceutical selling
                prices. Our product, VibXPresso, together with our consultation services will be
                pioneering in applying a V. natriegens based protein expression system in the recombinant protein and pharmaceutical industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                VibXpresso - a Vibrio natriegens strain would enable secretion of larger amounts of proteins in a shorter period of time. This allows a reduction in the costs of therapeutic protein production compared to the currently available options. The organization will provide VibXPresso as a customized service for pharmaceutical companies. This includes development of the Vibrio natriegens strain according to the customer’s needs, as well as consultation with developing the production process with Vibrio natriegens.

            <p>We will provide our services for a very minimal cost, guaranteeing its attractiveness to the pharmaceutical companies. The company using our products and services will agree on terms obliging them to adjusting the selling price of the therapeutic protein product in return for the saved resources in production. By providing our services to the therapeutic protein producing pharmaceutical companies, we aim at having an impact on the high prices of biopharmaceuticals. We plan to take care of daily tasks of the business by recruiting volunteers and creating a competitive internship program to attract university students. This way we can ensure stability and continuity, as well as maintain enough human resources while being a non-profit organization. </p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>A reduction in the selling prices of therapeutic proteins can save lives. This would provide people depending on therapeutic proteins with better access to biological medications. This will result in significant increase in quality of life among the large amount of people struggling with paying for their medication. However, the impact of our solution has even broader significance. Noteworthy impact points are highlighted in the figures below.</p>

            <small>Figure 10</small>
            <p>The effects of our solution for the end user is visualized in the updated user journey (figure 11). After successful implementation of VibXPresso in biopharmaceutical production and the subsequent effects on the selling prices achieved with the platform, the impact on the patients’ lives can be significant. We estimate that the solution we are proposing, will lead to a situation where a patient less likely has to suffer from financial issues or, in the worst case, quit their treatment due to financial reasons. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The long term goal would be to solve the unpleasant administration of therapeutic proteins with an orally administered option. This could be achieved by developing a strain that guarantees high protein yield and thus contributing to the research of producing orally administrative therapeutic protein medication.

            <p>After creating our business plan we realised that we had underestimated the importance of certain stakeholders. This includes the government and other legal entities. Our next steps would be talking to them about their willingness to collaborate to support our non-profit organization. As well as campaigning for general awareness of the current pricing structure and our solution, collaboration with other similar non profit-organization and lobbying so that government prefers purchasing drugs developed with VibXPresso strain.</p>
            <p>After proving our solution to be successful in the pharmaceutical industry, our platform could be utilized in many other industries. Next, we would expand to less regulated industries such as enzyme production, where manufacturing costs have a big effect on the selling prices since these industries spend less money on R&D and marketing than the pharmaceutical industry (Puetz & Wurm, 2019).
